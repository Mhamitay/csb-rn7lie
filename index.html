            Synopsis
          </h2>
          <p>
            Woody and the gang go on a road trip with new toy Forky, who's
            convinced he's trash and doesn't yet understand his role in the
            world. Along the way, Woody is unexpectedly reunited with
            independent spirit Bo Peep and finds himself faced with a decision,
            and a future, he never imagined.

              He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a boy
              named Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten, Woody
              served as the leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by
              looking out for each member of the group. When Andy enters
              adulthood and leaves for college, Woody is donated to a little
              girl named Bonnie Anderson. He remains with Bonnie for some time,
              before choosing to become an owner-less antique devoted to helping
              lost toys find owners, alongside his girlfriend.
